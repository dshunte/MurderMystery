			<h1>Dwaine is in Jane's Room</h1>
			<p>“Dwaine, I… I…” Jane broke down sobbing. I gave her a second to compose herself then offered her some tissues to mop up the torrent of tears that came streaming down her face “who would do such a thing? Alex was…….” She trailed off. “Can I tell you something in confidence?”</p>
			<p>“Of course,”</p>
			<p>“He asked me to marry him.”</p>
			<p>Speechless…</p>
			<p>“We reconnected recently, I had seen him out a night at the theatre and we got to reminiscing on old times. I congratulated him on all his success and how happy he must be with everything. He was modest about it, or as modest as Alex is capable of being, he said while he was happy something felt like it was missing. That he felt that he spent so much time chasing this life that he never got time to really live it. Since that day we have communicated regularly; email, phone, whatsapp. Tonight, after everyone went upstairs it was just him and I in the dining room and he was telling me that he finally knows what will complete him, he wanted to marry me and start a family. I really didn’t see this coming. I didn’t know what to say, after all the madness in Bahamas I had put that behind me and moved on, this was a lot to think about, what would Wilma think when she found out? He could see the shock on my face, he told me I didn’t have to answer right now, just that I think on it. I promised I would. He said he was going to stay down and clean up the mess we all made, we kissed and then I left to go to bed. That was the last time I saw him alive.”</p>
			<p>I was shocked at this revelation. “What time did you leave the dining room?”</p>
			<p>“It was 11:00 by the time we finished talking, I heard the grandfather clock in the study chiming as I went past”</p>
			<p>“Where was everyone else when you turned in?</p>
			<p>”Well, all the doors were closed so I assume everyone was in bed…… well everyone except you of course. You were probably still outside puking…….”</p>
			<p>I left Jane to be alone with her grief. </p>
