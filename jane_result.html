			<p>A few days later…………</p>
			<p>I think I’m over my schoolboy crush on Jane. After the physical evidence fully exonerated her of any wrongdoing, and she was released from custody, she left more examples of her extensive vocabulary on my answering machine at work, and the one at home, and in the mail, and the bathroom stalls at my local gym. She has however been found guilty of harassment and I was granted a restraining order against her, the local police don’t seem to keen on actually enforcing it though.</p>
			<p>I guess you live and you learn.</p>
			<p>Hhhmmm…. I wonder who actually killed Alex?</p>
