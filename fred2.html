			<h1>Dwaine is in Fred's Room</h1>
			<p>“Hi Fred. Just letting you know, I found a bloody shoeprint in the basement; it appears to be a man’s shoe. Is there anything you want to tell me?”</p>
			<p>“Me?! No! What are you implying?!”</p>
			<p>“No implications, just a question. You haven’t supplied a real alibi for your whereabouts after 10:30 aside from being asleep. So……”</p>
			<p>“That’s preposterous…. okay, okay but this stays between us, deal?” He takes my silence as assent. He continues, “I was pretty out of it, I don’t know if it was the drinks or what, but I remember the bedside clock saying 10:30 and I was in bed for sure and it can be proven, if you really have to, because I wasn’t alone. Wilma was with me.” My poker face clearly wasn’t as strong as I thought. “I know, I know, it sounds crazy but one minute I was sleeping and then the next there she was, with two glasses of wine, telling me that she had always had feelings for me but never acted on them. Things with me and the wife have been so rough lately, I don’t know, I thought, hey why not. Anyway, we fooled around a bit but the alcohol must really have had me because the next thing I know it was midnight and she said she was leaving. I don’t even know if we really did anything. That’s it, I swear! Shortly after that you were banging on my door. I didn’t want to say anything, but you have to believe me I had nothing to do with Alex’s murder!” </p>
