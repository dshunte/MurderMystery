			<h1>Dwaine is at Alex's House</h1>
			<p>I don't even know why I am here....</p><p> 
			We went to school together almost a decade ago! So what! The Young Super Sleuth Club we called ourselves (yes I know it is corny, give us a break, we were 12!). </p><p>Ironically, I am the only one to actually go into the P.I. business.......... if you could call the trickle of cases that actually come through my door "business"; my bank account sure doesn't. </p><p>Wilma and Jane still look fantastic though, I remember I had such a crush on Jane in high school but I wasn't Mr Cool like Harry; the eternal beach bum with the Peter Pan complex, so i got friend-zoned, probably for the best, I might have ended it up stuck in a dead end job and even deader end marriage, white picket fence and the obligatory 2.5 tikes (looking at you Fred, Mr. insurance salesman).</p><p> What really would have been nice was winding up the multimillionaire dot-com startup guru like Alex. I think he really invited us over here this weekend to show off and remind Jane what she gave up, can't blame him, I would do the same thing if I was in his handmade Italian leather shoes. </p><p>I know I know, maybe all this envy is what's keeping me awake, it surely isn't this bed, i 've never felt anything so soft! </p><p>Anyway, I think I remember seeing a bottle of Brandy in the dining room that we actually didn't get into last night, maybe that will help with this insomnia.</p>
