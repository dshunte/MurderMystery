			<p>“Evidence coming to light points to a crime of passion, anything new comes to mind that you would like to tell me Fred?”</p>
			<p>“Nope. I was barely awake, I don’t know what was in those drinks, I was totally KO’d, didn’t hear a thing. Doubt Wilma would have either, with those Ambien she takes for sleep, that’s some powerful stuff there.”</p>
			<p>“Yeah insomnia is no joke, though, I tend to take Brandy for mine.”</p>
			<p>“Ya know, I did find one of those empty Ambien wrappers in the hallway outside my door, can’t imagine how it got there.”</p>
			<p>“Okay Fred, well if you remember anything else let me know.” </p>
