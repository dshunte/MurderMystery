			<h1>Harry at the Jail</h1>
			<p>“Here is your killer officers. For years, he has been jealous of Alex. Once upon a time Harry was the star of the show. All the girls loved him, the guys looked up to him, he was the cool dude. But then everyone grew up, everyone except Harry. He was stuck being the eternal adolescent and he never forgave Alex for taking Wilma from him. Look at this ridiculous cowboy boots business scheme of his, this could only come from a truly troubled mind.”</p>
			<p>“Everybody said they loved the idea….”</p>
			<p>“Harry waited until Jane came upstairs, then he went back downstairs to confront Alex again about his moronic business venture. Things got heated and in a fit of desperation and rage he picked up the nearest object and plunged it into Alex’s chest repeatedly. Once he realized what he had done he raced to the basement in an attempt to get rid of the signs of his betrayal but little did he know that in his haste he left behind a shoe print etched out in the blood of his once friend, now victim.”</p>
			<p>“This is crazy! Yes we argued, yes it got heated, yes I was desperate but I didn’t kill Alex! He was my best friend.”</p>
			<p>“Sir, I think for now the best thing would be for you to come with us. We will get this all sorted out at the station.”</p>
