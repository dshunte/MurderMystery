			<h1>Dwaine is in Jane's Room</h1>
			<p>“Dwaine, I… I…” Jane broke down sobbing. I gave her a second to compose herself then offered her some tissues to mop up the torrent of tears that came streaming down her face “who would do such a thing? Alex was…….” She trailed off. “Can I tell you something in confidence?”</p>
			<p>“Of course,”</p>
			<p>“He asked me to marry him.”</p>
			<p>Speechless…</p>
			<p>“Well Jane, I have concrete evidence that someone was out of their room after Alex died.”</p>
			<p>“It wasn’t me! After Alex’s proposal I was so shocked I just sat in bed and stared.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it surely was someone.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe it was Wilma just blowing off some steam. The Bahamas conversation always brings up some bad memories for her. All you guys know that she and Alex were an item back then and even though you shouldn’t know, I am sure you also know that weekend when we were down in Bahamas she came in one night and caught me in bed with Alex, what came next wasn’t pretty. We were young, I was stupid and quite drunk. But that is no excuse. To this day I regret what I did to Wilma and I don’t know if our friendship ever recovered from it. What nobody knows, I didn’t know at the time and I don’t think Alex ever knew, is that she was pregnant with Alex’s child. I don’t know if it was the physical altercation that night, if it was emotional, if it was something else; but a few days later, Wilma lost the baby….. She hasn’t been able to conceive since.”</p>
			<p>That bombshell hit me with Hiroshima level devastation, to believe a close friend was dealing with that kind of pain all these years and I didn’t even know.</p>
			<p>“Wilma can never know I told you this, she would kill me” </p>
