			<h1>Dwaine is in Wilma's Room</h1>
			<p>“Wilma, I know you and Alex stayed close after school,” rumour is, not as close as she would have liked “do you have any idea of anyone who would want to hurt him?”</p>
			<p>“No, everyone loved Alex, he could be a bit pompous at times, but look at all of this” she gestured around the room “wouldn’t you be too if this was your life?” No arguments my side, this guest bedroom was bigger than my entire apartment.</p>
			<p>"What was your last recollections from last night?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I remember you stumbling out mumbling something about needing some air, I assume you were going outside to hide and puke,”</p>
			<p> I was not.</p>
			<p>“Jane was trying to keep up that tired charade about that Bahamas trip. Alex was smoking one of his stinky cigars and pretending to listen to Harry prattle on and on about his stupid cowboy boots. Fred was pretty quiet, I think he was out of it early, you know he has always been such a lightweight when it comes to drinks, he got up said he was going to retire for the night, I believe it was around 10:30 because shortly after I went up also. I remember hearing a door close and then open shortly after, there were some clomping steps down the hallway. Maybe a half an hour later I heard them again and then another door close. After that I took some Ambien and was out like a light until you woke me up this morning.”</p>
			<p>“Are you sure about the time you went up? Could it have been later?”</p>
			<p>“No, I don’t think so, I checked the time on my watch just before I went upstairs”</p>
			<p>“Thanks for your help Wilma, I promise you I will get to the bottom of this” </p>
