			<p>“I haven’t been fully honest with you Dwaine. I was trying to protect someone else but I have to come clean. I wasn’t in my room all night. I was with Fred, yes… Fred. He can definitely vouch for me between 10:30 and midnight. I did hear footsteps in the hallway around 11:00 but I heard them from Fred’s room, Alex was my friend, you know our history, despite everything that happened, Alex was the most important person to me in the world.</p>
			<p>“Well Wilma, I am coming around to think that you aren't the only person who isn’t been fully honest with me. We will see…” </p>
