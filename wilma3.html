			<p>“I“Hi Wilma, new evidence hints at a crime of passion. Do you have any idea of a grudge anyone may have had against Alex.”</p>

I think Harry  may have been pressuring a bit on the cowboy boots business, but that is typical Harry and his hare-brained schemes, you know how he is. Harry is Alex’s best friend I can’t imagine he could ever do something like this.”</p>
