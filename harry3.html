			<h1>Dwaine is in Harry's Room</h1>
			<p>“It seems, based on the murder weapon, that this was a crime of passion. From outside I thought I heard two male voices arguing. Fred has a corroborated alibi, it wasn’t me arguing, so that leaves you.”</p>
			<p>“It’s not how it looks. I lied earlier, yes I went back down to talk to Alex after I heard Jane go to bed. I didn’t want to say anything because I know how it would look. The cowboy boots idea isn’t going too well, I sunk all my money into it. I was hoping that Alex would help, he could have easily, but he just laughed at me. So we argued, and yes I raised my voice but that was it. I would never hurt Alex. He was my best friend. Afterwards I stormed up to bed and stayed there until you woke me up to tell me he was murdered. That is the truth, you have to believe me”</p>
			<p>“Well, you see how bad it looks.”</p>
			<p>“I know how it looks, that’s why I didn’t say anything…” </p>
