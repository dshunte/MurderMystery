			<h1>Dwaine is in Jane's Room</h1>
			<p>“The choice of murder weapon makes me feel the murder was of a personal nature, any reason someone would harbour negative feelings toward Alex?”</p>
			<p>“Dwaine, your guess is as good as mine. Alex hasn’t always been the easiest to get along with. I have had my issues with him, I’m sure you have too, we all have. He and Harry have had their fair share of shouting matches over one thing or the other. I know he and Jane went through a fairly rough patch a while back but to think any one of us could do this is crazy. I do recall hearing footsteps going down the hall after I turned in. Sounded pretty heavy but who knows.”</p>
			<p>“Thanks Jane. If I come across anything else, I may have more questions for you.” </p>
