			<p>A few weeks later….</p>
			<p>Just finished clearing out the last of my files from the cabinet in my office… well, what used to be my office. It appears that wrongly accusing your friend of 20 plus years for the murder of your other longtime friend, isn’t good for business, especially if you are supposed to be a private investigator. I guess I would have had to clear out of here anyway as my landlord was selling the property to an investment group. Coincidentally, the same thing happened at my apartment building, so I am kind of unemployed and homeless simultaneously. Apparently, both buildings were bought out to make way for outlets for this big new retail chain ’Harry’s World Famous Cowboy Boots’. It seems the notoriety of his case and subsequent exoneration brought him to the attention of some Texan oil tycoon who had millions to spend and absolutely loved his idea.</p>
			<p>Not sure if he still carries a grudge against me for accusing him of murdering his best friend……</p>
