			<h1>Fred at the Jail</h1>
			<p>“Officers, here is your killer! The tedium of his dreary day to day life got to be too much for him. A job going nowhere, a loveless marriage and a couple of brats of questionable paternity. All of this fueled his growing jealousy towards the victim. In Alex he saw everything he wished he was and would never be; successful, attractive, free. It became too much for him to bear, he feigned drunkenness so he could sneak away and plot the dastardly deed. After everyone retired to bed for the night, he snuck back downstairs, removed the knife from the kitchen, and stabbed Alex to death in the dining room.”</p>
			<p>“Dwaine! How could you think…., I would never….”</p>
			<p>“And that so called alibi he gave is laughable, he and Wilma come on! She must be covering for him I don’t know why, but look at him and look at her, she’s way out of his league! Maybe, she helped him with the murder, maybe he has something on her and forced her to lie.”</p>
			<p>“You bastard!” Fred lunges at me and has to be restrained by the officers.</p>
			<p>“It’s best that you come down to the station with us sir, we have some questions for you. You too ma’am.” A dumbfounded Wilma just stares slack jawed as the cuffs are placed on her wrists and she is led into the backseat of the police car.</p>
