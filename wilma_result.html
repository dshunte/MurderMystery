			<p>A few weeks later…</p>
			<p>We all gather together again in the same house where everything had changed for the four of us forever. We were here to mourn the loss of two dear friends. One we lost weeks ago and one we clearly lost years ago. The Wilma we knew back then, clearly had changed irrevocably.</p>
			<p>Alex had apportioned his estate to each of us in his will. With the money, Harry was able to get some traction on his cowboy boots dream, starting a small distributorship and had already signed on a few small retailers.</p>
			<p>Fred used his share to branch out on his own, he has a team of persons working for him at F&A Insurance Brokers and it has allowed him to spend more time home with the family.</p>
			<p>Wilma obviously through her actions forfeited her entitlement and Jane wanted none of the money, so we decided to use my share, hers and Wilma’s to start a non-profit to help persons battling with depression. The Alex Foundation hopefully will help a lot of persons who are struggling in silence start to learn to cope with their pain.</p>
			<p>For me, word of mouth spread about the case and my part in it and since then business has started to pick up a bit.</p>
			<p>We raise our glasses in toast “to Alex, gone but not forgotten.”</p>
