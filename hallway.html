			<h1>Dwaine is in Hallway with Everyone</h1>
			<p>Abruptly awoken by my aggressive door pounding, I now have the full complement of bleary-eyed guests gathered in the hallway outside of their rooms. </p><p>I spare the more squeamish of the group the goriest of details as I struggle through the grisly task thrust upon me of being bearer of such horrendous news. </p><p>Everyone's reaction seems thoroughly genuine, without slightest trace of artifice, if not for the inescapable laws of physics and logic I would be certain that all gathered in front of me were fully innocent of this heinous crime. </p><p> But I am sure of two things; Alex was murdered by one of us and I didn't do it.</p><p> As the only trained, professional investigator and as one of Alex's oldest friends it is my duty to get to the bottom of this. With considerable effort I get everyone to agree to return to their respective rooms, not to emerge again until I have figured this out.</p><p> I think I should head to the Living Room to gather my thoughts and start my investigations.
