			<h1>Dwaine is in the Dining Room</h1>
			<p>Owww! I hit my foot on something, that's what I get for sneaking around in the dark. This room seems a lot different with the lights off, multiple bottles of alcohol ingested. I was hoping not turn on the light in case someone sees it and I am forced to shareâ€¦....... unless it is Jane, hhhhmmmm, that could be....... nevermind. </p><p>Found it! Flicking on the light switch illuminates the room and my prize sits invitingly on the bar cart. What the hell did I trip on earlier? </P><p>As I walk around the large mahogany dining table that was the scene of such unabashed revelry mere hours ago, I spy the tip of the intricate hand stitching linking the sole to the plush, vegetable tanned leather of the upper. I coveted those shoes quite a bit last night, not so much so now with all the blood, a lot of blood.</p><p> Outside of a few first-aid courses I am by no means medically trained, but based on the glassy look of his eyes and the lack of telltale pulse, our host appears to be very dead! And oh yeah, the blood, a lot of blood; based on the numerous sites of its egress from the body it doesn't take a highly trained investigator (which i happen to be, not tooting my own horn) to deduce this no mere accident. </p><p>More so, as I have been walking the grounds outside since dinner working off my overindulgence, and no one has come or gone in that time, the only thing that can be deduced is that the killer is one of us! (not me, obviously). <p>What should I do? </p>
