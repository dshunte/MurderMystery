			<h1>Jane at the Jail</h1>
			<p>“Jane, give it up, we all see through your charade. Your story of Alex wanting to marry you makes no sense at all, you were just a fling to him, a mistake made in Bahamas. You thought what you told me would throw me off the scent and point the finger at Wilma. It quite nearly did, but clearly Wilma is long past whatever happened with Alex and is busy pursuing Harry. It seems if anyone didn’t get over what happened in the Bahamas it was you! I’m ashamed that I almost considered going out with you.”</p>
			<p>“Going out with me… what are you talking…….”</p>
			<p>“You clearly pretended to go to bed, but instead hid and waited until you heard Harry finish talking to Alex in the dining room. You probably said to yourself ‘now’s my chance’ and as soon as Harry left, snuck back into the room and committed the gruesome deed. I can’t begin to imagine the look on his face. Officers take this woman away!”</p>
			<p>“What madness is this?! Dwaine are you drunk?! I can’t believe….”</p>
			<p>“Ma’am I think it may be best you come with us and we sort this all out at the station.” The police take a clearly irate Jane away in their squad car while she regales me with some very colourful language.</p>
