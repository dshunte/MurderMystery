			<h1>Wilma at the Jail</h1>
			<p>“Come in officers, let me introduce you to your murderer, Wilma. Let me walk you through her devious scheme.</p>
			<p>After feigning exhaustion and excusing herself supposedly with the intention of going to bed, she returned downstairs to not only overhear Alex’s proposal to Jane but also his argument with Harry. She never was quite the same after Bahamas and I believe for years she secretly seethed with rage and jealousy directed towards Alex and Jane. I am sure what she overheard that night was the final straw that broke the camel’s back. Then and there she must have concocted her plan.</p>
			<p>She waited until Harry returned to his room, crept into the kitchen and seized the knife, then probably approached Alex quite unassumingly in the dining room, not raising his suspicions until it was too late and the knife were already in his chest. From there she stole one of Harry’s boots and used it to make the incriminating shoeprint in the basement and made sure to mention to me hearing clomping steps in the hallway.</p>
			<p>She preyed on poor Freddy’s low alcohol tolerance, coming into his room while he was passed out drunk and setting the time on his bedside clock back to 10:30 before waking him pretending to now be coming into his room amorously. I am sure she spiked one of the glasses of wine with one of her Ambien, making sure to set the clock back to midnight after he drifted off into a drug addled stupor rousing him momentarily enough for him to note the time as she left.”</p>
			<p>Wilma says nothing, but the smouldering eyes speak volumes.</p>
			<p>“She nearly would have gotten away with it, if not for a few small inconsistencies and my insomnia.”</p>
			<p>“I want my lawyer.” She hisses through gritted teeth.</p>
