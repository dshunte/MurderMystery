			<h1>Dwaine is in Harry's Room</h1>
			<p>“After you went outside to puke, the rest were asking me to tell them more about my line of cowboy boots I’m putting out”</p>
			<p>I did not go outside to puke…………</p>
			<p>“these boots are going to be the next big thing in men’s fashion. I am getting a lot of investor interest in it, I think Alex was ready to put a lot of money behind it, would you like to see my catalogue?”</p>
			<p>“Not right now, umm, maybe later, for now let’s focus on more pressing matters. Give me your recollection of events last night after dinner.”</p>
			<p>“Yeah, of course. Like I was saying, you went outside to puke, and the girls started arguing about the Bahamas again. I don’t think Wilma ever forgave Jane about what happened there. I wasn’t paying them too much attention, I think they should just bury the hatchet……” probably poor choice of words under the circumstances “Alex was puffing on a large one and we were discussing the investment opportunities. Fred wasn’t looking too good, so he begged off early and headed upstairs, not too long after that Wilma left too. Jane and Alex started to get that cozy look in their eyes and I started to feel like a third wheel, a lot has changed since school hasn’t it, so I left and went upstairs to bed.”</p>
			<p>“What time was that?”</p>
			<p>“It was around 10:00, I heard that grandfather clock in the study chiming when I closed the door to Wilma’s room.”</p>
			<p>“When you closed the door to Wilma’s room? I thought she had gone to bed by then.”</p>
			<p>“Yeah, I thought that was strange too? When I passed, the door was open and a draft was coming in from an open window, so I closed the door and went to bed, that was it for me until this morning.”</p>
			<p>I thanked Harry and left. </p>
